            If you're thinking of making a night of it, camping in the field is
            very much encouraged! Alternatively the nearest accommodation
            options are nearby in Ludlow.<br />

          <p>
            Parking spaces on site may be limited so if you know other guests
            attending, please try to car-share where possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            The nearest train station is Ludlow. The wedding venue is only 2
            miles from Ludlow, but there are no public transport connections,
            and there isnâ€™t a suitable route for walking from town. We advise
            organising a lift from another guest or getting a taxi.
          </p>

          <p class="highlight">
            There is a taxi service reserved for local trips to and from the
            venue. This will be in place for set hours at the beginning and end
            of the day. Exact times tbc. Please note, if you use this service
            you will still need to pay a standard taxi fee on the day.
